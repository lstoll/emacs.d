;;; init.el --- Where all the magic begins
;;
;; Part of the Emacs Starter Kit
;;
;; This is the first thing to get loaded.

;; "Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
;; same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger
;; and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish."
;; -Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

;; Load path etc:

(setq dotfiles-dir (file-name-directory
                    (or (buffer-file-name) load-file-name)))
(add-to-list 'load-path dotfiles-dir)
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "/elpa-to-submit"))
(setq autoload-file (concat dotfiles-dir "loaddefs.el"))
(setq package-user-dir (concat dotfiles-dir "elpa"))
(setq custom-file (concat dotfiles-dir "custom.el"))

;; These should be loaded on startup rather than autoloaded on demand
;; since they are likely to be used in every session:

(require 'cl)
(require 'saveplace)
(require 'ffap)
(require 'uniquify)
(require 'ansi-color)
(require 'recentf)

;;; This was installed by package-install.el.
;;; This provides support for the package system and
;;; interfacing with ELPA, the package archive.
;;; Move this code earlier if you want to reference
;;; packages in your .emacs.

    (load
     (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa/package.el"))

;; Load up starter kit customizations:

(require 'conf/starter-kit-defuns)
(require 'conf/bindings)
(require 'conf/starter-kit-misc)
(require 'conf/registers)
(require 'conf/eshell)
(require 'conf/lisp)
(require 'conf/ruby)
(require 'conf/js)

;; You can keep system- or user-specific customizations here:

(setq system-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir system-name ".el")
      user-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir user-login-name ".el"))

(if (file-exists-p system-specific-config) (load system-specific-config))
(if (file-exists-p user-specific-config) (load user-specific-config))
